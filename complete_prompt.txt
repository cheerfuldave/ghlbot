PROMPT: GHL Private Integration API Implementation

I need to implement a connection to the GoHighLevel Private Integration API with these exact working credentials and endpoints:

1. Project Requirements:
   - Connect to GHL Private Integration API
   - Retrieve location data
   - Use existing working credentials
   - Implement error handling
   - Test the connection

2. Working Credentials:
   Base URL: https://services.leadconnectorhq.com
   Location ID: me0EnocxsZH10tkDWF5K
   Token: pit-ca1cdf54-6c93-4bc4-86a4-66d2ae2b738c

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Set up the connection with working credentials
   - Test the API endpoint
   - Handle the response
   - Implement error handling
   - Document the working implementation

4. Expected Deliverables:
   - Working Python code
   - Implementation documentation
   - Test results
   - Error handling examples

Please provide the complete working implementation using these exact credentials and show me the results.
