JOB SEEKERS: Beware of job scams and fake employment offers.

It has come to our attention that fraudulent employment offers have been sent to job seekers by people who claim to be employees of Builders FirstSource (BFS). These scammers use a variety of tactics to engage with job seekers to commit identity theft, financial fraud, and other crimes. They can be very convincing, going as far as to steal the profile pictures of our actual recruiters from their LinkedIn profiles and using email addresses that contain words such as ‘@BuildersFirstSource’ or '@BFS.' The scammers will typically ask you to send money at some point (for equipment, training, or a uniform, etc.). A LEGITIMATE BFS RECRUITER OR HIRING MANAGER WILL NEVER ASK YOU TO SEND US MONEY. Also, you will never receive a job offer from us if we have not verbally interviewed you. If you ever receive an unsolicited or suspicious communication that demands any form of payment in connection with employment at BFS, you should consider it to be fraudulent and cease all contact with the sender. You can report US job scams to the FTC (www.ReportFraud.ftc.gov), your state attorney general, or econsumer.gov for international scams. You can also report any fraudulent activity to LinkedIn.",http://www.bldr.com,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFki0D5Ro4yKQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1633084118494/builders_firstsource_logo?e=1742428800&v=beta&t=yaPILGaZpEyQqYEO-DnXHZhXXaueB96Wh6Q_fmO4uEQ,https://careers.bldr.com/jobs/41727?src=LinkedIn&lang=en-us,Building Materials,10462,Raleigh,1998,,,,,,,2024-12-05T15:45:54.000Z,2024-12-18T17:44:30.878Z
