I uploaded the files: gohighlevel_bot.py, cli_interface.py

Incorprate express ap[i and only add to the eixsting project and function s tap into it and only update the existing process and project to add this as additional functionality. Don't redo everything sticvk with the existing plan and upgrade to to this  the files only as a sample of the working process for private integrations, Make a copy of the project, do the modifications, and then update MY project ghlbot. Don't get distractred and just try to repodruce the attached files. They just show the correct process to access private integrations and have zero to do with the project other than that. Do not do youir own thing or pretend anything. access my vercel and github with the tokens stored in secret variables and locate the ghlbot project. I want to update it to use private integrations with gohighlevel and add the function to the existing project and hompage as an option and create a new chatbot function that interacts with all the endpoints of the ghl private integrations. Use the existing project infrastrucue and modify it to use this process. The home page should have an additonal option to choose this version of the bot and work like the otjers but to integrate this process. https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003054-private-integrations-everything-you-need-to-know
