Here is a summary of the steps to use the GHL Private Integrations API:

1. **Obtain the GHL Private Integration Token**:
   - Log in to your GoHighLevel (GHL) dashboard.
   - Navigate to Settings → API Keys → Private Integration.
   - Create a new token or copy an existing one.
   - The token should look like: `pit-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

2. **Set Up the Base URL and Headers**:
   - Base URL: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com`
   - Headers:
     - `Authorization: Bearer <Your_Private_Integration_Token>`
     - `Version: 2021-07-28`
     - `Content-Type: application/json`

3. **Test the Connection**:
   ```python
   import requests

   base_url = "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com"
   token = "<Your_Private_Integration_Token>"  # Replace with your token

   headers = {
       "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
       "Version": "2021-07-28",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
   }

   response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/locations/<Your_Location_ID>", headers=headers)
   print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
   print("Response:", response.json())
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Ensure the token is valid and not expired.
   - Verify the Location ID is correct.
   - Check for typos in the headers or base URL.

5. **Example Endpoint**:
   - To fetch location details:
     - Endpoint: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/locations/<Your_Location_ID>`

Replace `<Your_Private_Integration_Token>` and `<Your_Location_ID>` with your actual token and location ID.
