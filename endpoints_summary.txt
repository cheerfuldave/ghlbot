Certainly, let's go through the exact steps to connect to the GHL Private Integrations API.

## Obtaining the GHL Private Integration Token

1. Log in to your GoHighLevel (GHL) dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys → Private Integration**.
3. Create a new token or copy an existing one.
4. The token should look like: `pit-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

## Complete Working Code Example

```python
import requests

base_url = "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com"
token = "pit-ca1cdf54-6c93-4bc4-86a4-66d2ae2b738c"  # Replace with your token

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    "Version": "2021-07-28",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/locations/me0EnocxsZH10tkDWF5K", headers=headers)
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())
```

## Explanation

1. **Base URL**: The base URL for the GHL Private Integrations API is `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com`.
2. **Token**: Replace `"pit-ca1cdf54-6c93-4bc4-86a4-66d2ae2b738c"` with your actual GHL Private Integration token.
3. **Headers**:
   - `Authorization`: Set the authorization header to `"Bearer {token}"`, where `{token}` is your GHL Private Integration token.
   - `Version`: Set the version header to `"2021-07-28"`.
   - `Content-Type`: Set the content type header to `"application/json"`.
4. **Endpoint**: In the example, we're testing the `/locations/{locationId}` endpoint, where `{locationId}` is your GHL location ID (e.g., `"me0EnocxsZH10tkDWF5K"`).
